This is a fork of the Devuan unstable mdadm (4.5) package intended to build on daedalus and to have all systemd support files removed.

Present State
-------------
Builds on my daedalus system but hasn't been tested yet. Some systemd support files won't be
installed anymore but two are still part of the mdadm package.
